</div>

Aether is a modern, cloud-native programming language designed for building scalable, distributed systems with elegant syntax and robust safety features.

## Features

- **Cloud-First Architecture**: Native support for cloud APIs, service discovery, and containerized deployments
- **Object-Oriented Core**: First-class support for classes, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism
- **Elegant Syntax**: Clean, minimal syntax inspired by modern languages
- **Hybrid Type System**: Static typing by default with optional dynamic typing
- **Built-in Cloud Integration**: Direct cloud provider SDK integration
- **Modern Concurrency**: Async/await, actors, and reactive streams
- **Security-Focused**: Language-level constructs for sandboxing and capability-based security

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

You can download pre-built binaries for your operating system from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/iamvirul/Aetherlang/releases) page.

#### Windows
1. Download `aeth` from the latest release
2. Rename it to `aeth.exe` (optional)
3. Add the binary location to your PATH environment variable
4. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run `aeth --version` to verify the installation

#### macOS
1. Download `aeth` from the latest release
2. Make it executable:
   
   ```bash
   chmod +x aeth
   ```
4. Move it to a location in your PATH:
   
   ```bash
   sudo mv aeth /usr/local/bin/aeth
   ```
6. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   aeth --version
   ```
  
#### If macOS blocks the binary with a message like:

> “aeth” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

####  Do this step *before* or *after* verifying the installation:

#### 1. **Manually allow the binary via Gatekeeper:**

* Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security**
* Scroll down to the **Security** section
* You should see a message like “aeth was blocked…”
* Click **“Allow Anyway”**

Then run:

```bash
aeth
```

macOS may still block it. If so:

#### 2. **Force open from Terminal:**

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine aeth
```

Then you can run:

```bash
aeth --version
```

This removes the quarantine attribute, allowing the binary to run without triggering Gatekeeper.

---

#### Linux
1. Download `aeth` from the latest release
2. Make it executable:
   
   ```bash
   chmod +x aeth
   ```
4. Move it to a location in your PATH:
   
   ```bash
   sudo mv aeth /usr/local/bin/aeth
   ```
6. Verify the installation:
   
   ```bash
   aeth --version
   ```

### Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source, you'll need Rust installed on your system:

1. Install Rust from [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamvirul/Aetherlang.git
cd Aetherlang
```

4. Build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

6. The compiled binaries will be in `target/release/`

### Homebrew (macOS)

If you're on macOS, you can install Aetherlang using Homebrew:

1.  **Tap the repository:**

    ```bash
    brew tap iamvirul/aetherlang
    ```

2.  **Install Aetherlang:**

    ```bash
    brew install aetherlang
    ```


### Using the Docker Image

You can use the pre-built Docker image to run Aetherlang without needing to install Rust or any dependencies.

1.  **Pull the image from GitHub Container Registry:**

    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/iamvirul/aether-lang:latest
    ```

2.  **Run the image:**

    To run the Aetherlang runtime, mount your project directory to the `/app` directory inside the container.

    ```bash
    docker run -v $(pwd):/app ghcr.io/iamvirul/aether-lang:latest aeth run /app/your_service.ath
    ```

    Replace `your_service.ath` with the path to your Aetherlang service file.

## Getting Started

### Hello World

```aether
service HelloService {
  @get("/hello")
  endpoint greet(name: String): String {
    return "Hello, \(name) from Aether!";
  }
}
```

### Running the Service

```bash
aeth run hello.ath
```

## Aetherlang File Icon

This extension provides a specific icon for Aetherlang (`.ath`) files through its own file icon theme called "Aetherlang Icons".

**Important Note:** To see the Aetherlang file icon, you will need to activate the "Aetherlang Icons" theme. You can do this by:

1.  Going to `File > Preferences > Theme > File Icon Theme` (or `Code > Settings > Theme > File Icon Theme` on macOS).
2.  Selecting "Aetherlang Icons" from the list.

**Caveat:** The "Aetherlang Icons" theme currently *only* provides an icon for `.ath` files. If you select this theme, icons for other file types (e.g., `.js`, `.py`, `.txt`) provided by your previously active icon theme will likely disappear or revert to basic defaults. 

For seamless integration with popular icon themes (like Material Icon Theme, Seti, etc.), we plan to contribute the Aetherlang icon to those themes in the future.

## Installation

1.  Download the `.vsix` file from the [releases page](YOUR_GITHUB_RELEASES_PAGE_URL_HERE) (or wherever you distribute it).
2.  In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
3.  Run the command "Extensions: Install from VSIX...".
4.  Select the downloaded `.vsix` file.
5.  Reload VS Code if prompted.
